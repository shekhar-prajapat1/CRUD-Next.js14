## 📌 **Database & Data Management**
This project uses **Appwrite**, a **NoSQL document-based database** for managing structured data.

### **🗄 How Data is Stored in Appwrite**
- **Collections** → Like tables in SQL, used to store structured data.  
- **Documents** → Like rows in SQL, each document has a unique `$id`.  
- **Attributes** → Like columns in SQL, define the type of data stored.  

### **📜 Supported Data Types in Appwrite**
| **Data Type** | **Description** | **Example** |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **String** | Stores text values | `"Hello World"` |
| **Integer** | Stores whole numbers | `100` |
| **Float** | Stores decimal numbers | `99.99` |
| **Boolean** | Stores `true` or `false` values | `true` |
| **Email** | Stores email addresses | `"user@example.com"` |
| **URL** | Stores web URLs | `"https://example.com"` |
| **Enum** | Stores predefined values from a list | `["pending", "approved", "rejected"]` |
| **IP Address** | Stores an IP address | `"192.168.1.1"` |
| **DateTime** | Stores a timestamp | `"2024-03-13T12:00:00Z"` |
| **JSON** | Stores structured JSON objects | `{"name": "Shekhar", "age": 22}` |
